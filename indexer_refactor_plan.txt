# Layer Block Explorer - GraphQL Indexer Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan to migrate the Layer Block Explorer from using RPC endpoints as the primary data source to using a GraphQL indexer as the primary source, with RPC as a fallback option.

## Current Architecture Analysis
- Primary data source: RPC endpoints (mainnet.tellorlayer.com, node-palmito.tellorlayer.com)
- Sophisticated RPC manager with circuit breaker pattern and failover logic
- Real-time updates via WebSocket subscriptions
- API routes in src/pages/api/ for data fetching
- Redux store for state management
- Components fetch data through API routes and direct RPC calls

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

#### 1.1 Install GraphQL Dependencies
```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

#### 1.2 Create GraphQL Client Configuration
- Create `src/utils/graphqlClient.ts` to configure Apollo Client
- Set up connection pooling, error handling, and retry logic
- Configure the GraphQL endpoint URL
- Implement request/response interceptors for error handling


#### 1.3 Create Data Source Manager ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create `src/utils/dataSourceManager.ts` to manage primary (GraphQL) vs fallback (RPC) data sources
- ✅ Implement circuit breaker pattern for GraphQL endpoint
- ✅ Add health checks for GraphQL endpoint
- ✅ Create unified interface for data fetching with automatic fallback
- ✅ Create `src/utils/unifiedDataService.ts` with example implementations
- ✅ Create example API route `src/pages/api/unified-example.ts`
- ✅ Create comprehensive documentation `src/utils/README_DataSourceManager.md`

### Phase 2: GraphQL Schema and Types

#### 2.1 Define GraphQL Types (COMPLETED)
- Create `src/types/graphql.ts` with TypeScript interfaces matching your GraphQL schema
- Define types for:
  - Blocks (Block, BlockHeader, BlockData)
  - Transactions (Tx, TxEvent, TxResult)
  - Validators (Validator, ValidatorPower, Delegation)
  - Reporters (Reporter, ReporterSelector, ReportStatus)
  - Bridge data (Deposit, Withdrawal, Attestation)
  - Oracle data (OracleReport, QueryData)

#### 3.2 Refactor API Routes ✅ COMPLETED
Update all API routes in `src/pages/api/` to use GraphQL as primary source:

**High Priority Routes:**

- ✅ `/api/validators.ts` - Validator data
- ✅ `/api/reporters.ts` - Reporter data
- ✅ `/api/oracle-data/[queryId].ts` - Oracle data

**Medium Priority Routes:**
- ✅ `/api/oracle-data/[queryId].ts` - Oracle data (completed above)

**Implementation Pattern Applied:**
```typescript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    // Try GraphQL first
    const graphqlData = await graphqlService.getData(params)
    return res.status(200).json(graphqlData)
  } catch (graphqlError) {
    console.warn('GraphQL failed, falling back to RPC:', graphqlError)
    try {
      // Fallback to RPC
      const rpcData = await rpcService.getData(params)
      return res.status(200).json(rpcData)
    } catch (rpcError) {
      return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Both data sources failed' })
    }
  }
}
```

**APIs Still Using RPC Only (No GraphQL Equivalent Available):**
- `/api/current-cycle.ts` - Current cycle data (no GraphQL equivalent)
- `/api/reporter-count.ts` - Reporter count (no GraphQL equivalent)
- `/api/bridge-data/[queryId]/[timestamp].ts` - Bridge data (no GraphQL equivalent)
