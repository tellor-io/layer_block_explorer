`Layer Block Explorer` is a light explorer for Tellor Layer built on top of the [dexplorer] (https://github.com/arifintahu/dexplorer/)template.

## Features

- A dashboard to easily monitor chain activity
- The ability to subscribe to the latest blocks and transactions
- A search function that allows you to quickly find blocks, transactions, and accounts
- A list of active validators

## How is Dexplorer different from other explorers?

`Tellor Layer Block Explorer` is only a frontend app, meaning there is no cache or pre-processing. It pulls data from RPC as needed.
